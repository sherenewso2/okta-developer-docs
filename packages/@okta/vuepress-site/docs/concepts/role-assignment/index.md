# Role Assignment
Role assignment to principals makes them administrators of your org.

## Standard Role Assignment
The following role types are provided and supported out of the box:
| Role type                               | Label                               | Optional targets                      |
| :-------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `API_ACCESS_MANAGEMENT_ADMIN`           | API Access Management Administrator |                                       |
| `APP_ADMIN`                             | Application Administrator           | Apps                                  |

| `HELP_DESK_ADMIN`                       | Help Desk Administrator             | [Groups](/docs/reference/api/groups/) |
| `MOBILE_ADMIN`                          | Mobile Administrator                |                                       |
| `ORG_ADMIN`                             | Organizational Administrator        |                                       |
| `READ_ONLY_ADMIN`                       | Read-Only Administrator             |                                       |
| `REPORT_ADMIN`                          | Report Administrator                |                                       |
| `SUPER_ADMIN`                           | Super Administrator                 |                                       |
| `USER_ADMIN`                            | Group Administrator                 | [Groups](/docs/reference/api/groups/) |

Standard role assignment is done in two steps:
1. Assign a role to a user or group. At this point the admin has the supported privileges fo the role over all resources across organization.
2. (Optional) If the role supports targets, use one of the [target operations](/docs/reference/api/roles/#role-target-operations) to specify which specific resource the admin can manage.

Note that the entities involved in standard role assignment are:
* a role; identified either by type or id returned from [listing API](/docs/reference/api/roles/#list-roles)
* a principal; either a group or a user
* (Optional) a resource; when using target [target operations](/docs/reference/api/roles/#role-target-operations) this could be either an app or a group

## Custom Role Assignment
Custom roles can be built by piecing [permissions](/docs/reference/api/roles/#permission-types) together. Once a custom role is built, you can use its id or name to assign to admins. The process is:
1. Build a custom role
2. Build a set of resources
3. Bind the admin with the role from step 1 targeting the resource set from step 2

An assignment of a role to an admin is called a [binding](/docs/reference/api/roles/#binding-object). Conceptually, a binding is identified by the role id. A maximum of one role per resource set will be allowed. Assignment of more admins to the same role targetting the same resource set is possible and they are added as [members]((/docs/reference/api/roles/#member-object)) of the same binding. Hence a binding could simply be seen as:
```json
{
  "${roleId}": [
    "${memberId1}",
    "${memberId2}",
    ...
  ]
}
```

Therefore, when dealing with custom roles, three entities are always in play:
* a role; identified by its name or id
* a principal; either a group or a user
* a resource-set; identified by its id

### Resource Sets
Custom roles can only be assigned if scoped to a set of recourses from the beginning. In other words, you need to have a resource set in order to be able to assign a custom role.

A resource set is simply a collection of resources. The following resources are currently supported:
* All users
* All groups
* A specific group
* All users within a specific group
Note that the distinction between users and groups allows for creating custom admins that are only scoped to users or groups.

### Identifiers
#### Resource Identifiers
In order to specify a resource targeted by a resource set, you will simply use the REST URL of the corresponding Okta API:
* All users
  ``` http
  https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/users
  ```
* All groups
  ``` http
  https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/groups
  ```
* A specific group
  ``` http
  https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/groups/${targetGroupId}
  ```
* All users within a specific group
  ``` http
  https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/groups/${targetGroupId}/users
  ```

> **Tip:** If you use a role with permissions that don't apply to the resources in the resource set, the admin role will have no effect. For example, the `okta.users.profile.manage` permission will give the admin no privileges if granted to a resource set that only included `https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/groups/${targetGroupId}` resources. If you want the admin to be able to manage the users within the group the resource set must include the corresponding `https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/groups/${targetGroupId}/users` resource.

#### Member Identifiers
In order to specify binding members, you will simply use the REST URL of the corresponding Okta API:
* A specific user
  ``` http
  https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/users/${memberUserId}
  ```
* A specific group
  ``` http
  https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/groups/${memberGroupId}
  ```

## Custom vs. Standard
1. An admin can have both types of standard role assignments and custom role bindings. Note that privileges granted to an admin are an aggregate of:
    * standard roles directly assigned
    * standard roles granted through group membership
    * custom roles directly assigned
    * custom roles granted through group membership

    As a result, if an admin was granted a standard role limited to a single group and at the same time received group management privileges on all groups in the org through a custom org, the ultimate outcome is group management on all groups.
2. Not all permissions and resources are currently supported by custom roles.
3. A custom role cannot be assigned without a resource set, hence always being applicable only to a subset of resources. Standard roles on the other hand are always initially granted at the entire org. They are only scoped to specific resources byt subsequent invoking of the [target operations](/docs/reference/api/roles/#role-target-operations).
